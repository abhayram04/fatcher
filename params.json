A page report will be recorded only once. Unique reports will be generated based on user's browser login info.\r\n\r\nThe count of reports on a page and the domain will help readers not fall prey to fake news or nonfactual content. While internet provides access to vast amounts of information, its easy to lose to lose our way in the vastness.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nUser must be logged into Chrome and have the sync feature enabled. We only ask for this to be able to add your report based on your Email ID and to make the process seamless.
